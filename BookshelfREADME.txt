The repository currently only contains one file. 

FILE: “Bookshelf.sql”:

Running this file in the postgreSQL RDMS will populate the active database with all the tables and views used throughout the ‘Bookshelf’ project.
PostgreSQL-specific domains are used (such as ‘text’), and may not be compatible with other RDMS using the ‘Varchar()’ domain.
